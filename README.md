# CN3765 Multi-Chemistry Charger

This project implements a **multi-chemistry battery charger** based on the **CN3765** monolithic IC.  
The CN3765 is a high-efficiency step-down (buck) controller that supports **Li-Ion, LiFePO‚ÇÑ, and Lead-Acid (SLA)** batteries, providing accurate constant-current (CC) and constant-voltage (CV) charging profiles.  

The entire hardware design was developed from scratch, including schematic, PCB layout, and component selection, ensuring a stable and reliable charger suitable for embedded systems and lab use.
